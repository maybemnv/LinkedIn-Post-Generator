# LinkedIn Post Generator

I built this Streamlit application to help generate engaging LinkedIn posts using LLMs. It selects from different topics, lengths, and languages to create content that feels authentic and professional.

## Why I Built This

After noticing how time-consuming it can be to write quality LinkedIn posts consistently, I wanted to create a tool that could help streamline this process. The app leverages Llama3-70B (via Groq's API) to generate posts that match specific topics and styles.

## Features

- **Topic Selection**: Pick from various professional topics I've categorized
- **Adjustable Length**: Generate short, medium, or long posts depending on your needs
- **Language Options**: Works with both English and Hinglish content
- **Few-Shot Learning**: I implemented examples to help the model understand the right tone and style
- **Simple UI**: Built with Streamlit for a straightforward user experience

## Setting Up

1. Clone my repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/maybemnv/LinkedIn-Post-Generator.git
cd linkedin-post-generator
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. You'll need to set up a `.env` file with your own Groq API key:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

## How to Use It

Just run the app with:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

Then select your topic, choose how long you want the post to be, pick your language, and hit "Generate." The model will create a post based on what you've selected.

## Data Processing

I created a preprocessing pipeline that:
1. Extracts metadata from posts (line count, language, tags)
2. Standardizes tags to make categorization more consistent
3. Prepares posts for use as few-shot examples

If you want to process more posts, run:
```bash
python preprocessing.py --input data/raw_posts.json --output data/processed_posts.json
```

## Main Dependencies

- streamlit for the web interface
- langchain and langchain-groq to handle the LLM interactions
- python-dotenv for environment management
- Check requirements.txt for the complete list

## Future Plans

I'm planning to enhance this with:
- More language support
- Custom topic input field
- A larger database of examples
- Different tone selection options
- User feedback system to improve generation quality

## Thanks

Special thanks to Groq for providing access to Llama3-70B and to all the LinkedIn content creators whose posts helped me understand different content styles.
